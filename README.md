This project showcases a responsive grid of testimonial cards, each featuring a real-world user‚Äôs experience.

Created as part of the building challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## üîç Overview

This site was built using semantic HTML5 and custom CSS, with accessibility and responsive design in mind where each testimonial card is styled individually using CSS Grid with named areas.

It features subtle hover effects, adaptive color schemes (light/dark), semantic ARIA markup, and is also optimized for reduced motion preferences and high-contrast environments.

- Dark mode support using `prefers-color-scheme`
- Accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- Custom layout using named `grid-template-areas`
